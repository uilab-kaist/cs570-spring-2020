> We will not reply to any emails about course addition. Please refer to the section "Course Addition" for detailed information.


## Update in relation to COVID‑19
According to the policy of South Korea government and KAIST against the COVID-19 spreading throughout the nation, we have decided to deliver a lecture online for the first two weeks. For students who have trouble due to the postponed course closing, please refer to the notice in KLMS **after the semester starts.**


## Course Addition
> This section is only for those who failed at registering this course on the system. If succeeded already, you can take this course no matter which department you belong to.

> We will not reply to any emails about course addition. 

Considering a huge demand for course addition, we decide to **only** approve requests from **1st or 2nd year MS/MS-PhD/PhD students at School of Computing. There will be no exceptions/changes in our policy.** When applicable, you should **apply for course addition in the Academic System during the course add/drop period [(Link)](https://portal.kaist.ac.kr/ennotice/student_notice/11583152634892)**. The professor will approve **every** qualified request, **NOT** on a first come first served basis. The request from every other students will not be approved (e.g. undergraduate students, graduate students in EE and AI). We ask for your kind understanding regarding this matter.

수강 추가 기간에 많은 수요가 예상되어, **전산학부 석사/석박통합/박사 1, 2년차 학생들은 대상**에 한해 증원 신청을 받을 예정입니다. 안타깝지만 해당 자격을 갖추지 않은 학생들의 경우 추가 신청을 하더라도 허가를 받을 수 없습니다.(하지만 이미 수강 신청을 완료한 학생이라면 수강하실 수 있습니다.) 만약 해당 자격을 갖춘 학생이라면 **수강신청변경 기간동안 학사시스템을 통해 신청[(Link)](https://portal.kaist.ac.kr/ennotice/student_notice/11583152634892)하시면 교수님께서 승인해 주실 예정입니다.(선착순 X)**.

## Team Projects

- Team project will be a major part of the class, especially during the second half
- Projects will be basically replication/modifications of recent research in AI/ML
- More details will be described in the document below
- https://uilab-kaist.github.io/cs570-spring-2020/project
